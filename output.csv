"1510508117.0401425","http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/trumps-offers-mediate-protracted-south-china-sea-feud-51093975"," . President Donald Trump on Sunday offered to mediate in the South China Sea disputes, while his Chinese counterpart played down concerns over Beijing's military buildup and the prospects of war in the contested waters. . Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke separately about the territorial rifts ahead of an annual summit of Southeast Asian nations that also includes the U.S., China and other global players. The disputes are expected to get the spotlight at the summit, along with the North Korean nuclear threat and terrorism. . The long-simmering disputes are one issue where the two major powers' influence, focus and military might have been gauged, with the U.S. and China both calling for a peaceful resolution but taking contrasting positions in most other aspects of the conflict. . Unlike China, the U.S. is not a claimant to the potentially oil-rich and busy waters, but it has declared that it has a national interest in ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight and the peaceful resolution of the disputes. Several nations back an active American military presence in the region to serve as a counterweight to China's increasingly assertive actions, including the construction of seven man-made islands equipped with military installations. . ""I'm a very good mediator and arbitrator,"" Trump said at a news conference with Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, before flying to Manila for the summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. . Trump's offer faces major obstacles. For one, China has steadfastly opposed what it calls U.S. meddling in the disputes and has balked at the U.S. Navy's incursions into what Beijing considers its territorial waters in the South China Sea. . The Philippines, the head of ASEAN's rotational chairmanship, said member states of the 10-nation regional bloc have to consult each other but thanked Trump for the offer. . ""He is the master of the art of the deal but, of course, the claimant countries have to answer as a group or individually ... mediation involves all the claimants and nonclaimants,"" Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano told reporters. . Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Xi, during a meeting in Danang, Vietnam, where they attended the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum this past week, assured him of China's peaceful intentions in the strategic waterway, where Beijing, the Philippines, Vietnam and three other governments have overlapping claims. . When he raised concerns over China's increasing military capability in the South China Sea, Duterte said Xi replied, ""No, it's nothing."" . ""He acknowledged that war cannot be promoted by anybody, (that) it would only mean destruction for all of us,"" Duterte told reporters after flying back to Manila. ""He knows that if he goes to war, everything will blow up."" . The Chinese leader, however, would not back down on Beijing's territorial claim, Duterte said, and justified his decision not to immediately demand Chinese compliance with a ruling by a U.N.-linked tribunal that invalidated China's sweeping claims in the South China Sea on historical grounds. . China has dismissed that ruling as a ""sham"" and did not participate in the arbitration case that the Philippines filed during the administration of Duterte's predecessor. Duterte took steps to thaw frosty relations with China after he won the presidency last year. . ""If you go to the negotiating table and you start with the statement that I am here to claim validity of our ownership, you're wasting your time. They will not talk about it,"" Duterte said of China. . The ASEAN summit opens Monday under extra-tight security at a theater and convention complex by Manila Bay. Duterte hosted a gala dinner Sunday for leaders including Trump, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who all wore traditional barong shirts. . Riot police used shields and water hoses Sunday to push back hundreds of left-wing activists who tried to hold a protest at the U.S. Embassy and carried placards that read ""Ban Trump."" At least 20 protesters were injured in the brief scuffle and one was arrested, according to protest leaders, adding that the demonstrators dispersed after burning a mock U.S. flag. . ——— .

The ""Pitch Perfect"" star wrote on Twitter Saturday that she took a break from ""creating [a] new comedy overseas"" to share her story that allegedly involves ""a male star in a position of power."" .  . I've been away in a 'bubble' of sorts creating new comedy overseas but it's so hard to hear all these stories relating to sexual harassment and assault in Hollywood. As you guys know, I'm a pretty strong and confident person but even I have a story to tell. .  . Wilson, 37, claimed that after meeting him in a room, he asked her ""repeatedly"" to perform a sex act. . ""All whilst his male 'friends' tried to film the incident on their iPhones and laughed,"" she continued. ""I repeatedly said no and eventually got out of the room."" .  .  .  .  .  .  . ""I called my agent immediately and my lawyer made a complaint with the studio -- basically to protect myself that in the event something similar ever occurred I'd be able to walk out of the job and not obliged to return,"" the Australian actress wrote. .  . I called my agent immediately and my lawyer made a complaint with the studio - basically to protect myself that in the event something similar ever occurred I'd be able to walk out of the job and not obliged to return. .  . Wilson claimed she was then ""threatened by one of the star's representatives to be nice and support the male star. I refused. The whole thing was disgusting."" . This isn't the first time she's sharing this story publicly, Wilson said. . ""I've told hundreds of people in the industry the story in more graphic detail basically to warn them off this individual,"" she wrote on Twitter. .  . Later I was threatened by one of the star's representatives to be nice and support the male star. I refused. The whole thing was disgusting.I've told hundreds of people in the industry the story in more graphic detail basically to warn them off this individual. .  . Wilson also shared a separate incident in which she said she felt uncomfortable with a ""top director"" in Hollywood while the two were alone in a hotel room. . ""I thought we were there to talk comedy,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""Nothing physical happened because the guy's wife called and started abusing him over the phone for sleeping with actresses and luckily she was yelling so loud ... that I could hear her and I bolted out of there immediately. . ""I was so naive the thought of anything happening apart from 'work talk' didn't even cross my mind,"" Wilson added. .  .  . The actress, who will next be seen on the big screen in ""Pitch Perfect 3,"" out Dec. 22, wrote that she realized she's one of the ""lucky"" ones. . ""I feel lucky that I grew up in a pro-female environment, going to an all-girls high school, and that I have such a strong sense of self and have taken self-defense classes. I had the ability to escape both incidents. I realize not everyone is as lucky,"" she said. .  . I feel lucky that I grew up in a pro-female environment, going to an all-girls high school, and that I have such a strong sense of self and have taken self-defense classes. I had the ability to escape both incidents. I realize not everyone is as lucky. .  . ""To hear how prevalent sexual harassment and assault is, is just so saddening,"" Wilson continued. ""I know my stories aren't as horrific as other women and men have described -- but if you've ever experienced anything like this I feel for you and can relate on some level."" .  . To hear how prevalent sexual harassment and assault is, is just so saddening. I know my stories aren't as horrific as other women and men have described - but if you've ever experienced anything like this I feel for you and can relate on some level. .  . ""I know, moving forward, that if I witness this behavior, whether it happens to me or someone I know, I will no longer be POLITE. Interpret that as you will,"" she concluded. .  . I know, moving forward, that if I witness this behavior, whether it happens to me or someone I know, I will no longer be POLITE. Interpret that as you will. .  . A rep for Wilson told ABC News she had no additional comment."
