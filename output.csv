A former Trump campaign adviser’s admission that he had interactions with alleged government-connected Russians is leaving Attorney General Jeff Sessions facing renewed questions about how much he knew about Russian election interference. . Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of ties between the Trump campaign and Russia was triggered in part by Mr Sessions’ prior contact with the Russian government. . The top law enforcement official recused himself from an examination of Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election after it was revealed he had not disclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak during the presidential campaign - a move that infuriated Donald Trump and set in motion a chain of events that would eventually lead the appointment of Mr Mueller. . Now Democrats are again asking questions about Mr Sessions’ testimony in January that he wasn't aware of any campaign contacts with Russia, after a court document revealed how campaign officials were presented with the option of talking to Russia. . According to a document laying out the case against Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, Mr Papadopoulos repeatedly floated the idea of a possible meeting between the campaign and officials in Moscow. He pitched helping to arrange a meeting between Mr Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a March 31 gathering with “Trump and other foreign policy advisors”, the document says. . A post from Mr Trump’s Instagram account that day shows Mr Papadopoulos seated around a table with both Mr Trump and Mr Sessions. CNN reports that Mr Sessions rebuffed the prospective meeting. . Mr Manafort is a Republican strategist and former Trump campaign manager. He resigned from that post over questions about his extensive lobbying overseas, including in Ukraine where he represented pro-Russian interests.Mr Manafort turned himself in at FBI headquarters to special counsel Robert Mueller’s team on Oct 30, 2017, after he was indicted under seal on charges that include conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading US Foreign Agents Registration Act statements, false statements, and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts. .

Mr Gates joined the Trump team in spring 2016, and served as a top aide until he left to work at the Republican National Committee after the departure of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.Mr Gates' had previously worked on several presidential campaigns, on international political campaigns in Europe and Africa, and had 15 years of political or financial experience with multinational firms, according to his bio.Mr Gates was indicted alongside Mr Manafort by special counsel Robert Mueller's team on charges that include conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading US Foreign Agents Registration Act statements, false statements, and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts. . AP . George Papadopoulos was a former foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign, having joined around March 2016.Mr Papadopoulos plead guilty to federal charges for lying to the FBI as a part of a cooperation agreement with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.Mr Papadopoulos claimed in an interview with the FBI that he had made contacts with Russian sources before joining the Trump campaign, but he actually began working with them after joining the team.Mr Papadopoulos allegedly took a meeting with a professor in London who reportedly told him that Russians had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. The professor also allegedly introduced Mr Papadopoulos to a Russian who was said to have close ties to officials at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Mr Papadopoulos also allegedly was in contact with a woman whom he incorrectly described in one email to others in the campaign as the ""niece"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin. . Twitter . The President's eldest son met with a Russian lawyer - Natalia Veselnitskaya - on 9 June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York. He said in an initial statement that the meeting was about Russia halting adoptions of its children by US citizens. Then, he said it was regarding the Magnitsky Act, a US law blacklisting Russian human rights abusers. In a final statement, Mr Trump Jr released a chain of emails that revealed he took the meeting in hopes of getting information Ms Veselnitskaya had about Hillary Clinton's alleged financial ties to Russia. He and the President called it standard ""opposition research"" in the course of campaigning and that no information came from the meeting. The meeting was set up by an intermediary, Rob Goldstone. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort were also at the same meeting. . Getty Images . Mr Kushner is President Donald Trump's son-in-law and a key adviser to the White House. He met with a Russian banker appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in December. Mr Kushner has said he did so in his role as an adviser to Mr Trump while the bank says he did so as a private developer.Mr Kushner has also volunteered to testify in the Senate about his role helping to arrange meetings between Trump advisers and Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. .

Former tabloid journalist and now music publicist Rob Goldstone is a contact of the Trump family through the previously Trump-owned 2013 Miss Universe pageant, which took place in Moscow. In June 2016, he wrote to Donald Trump Jr offering a meeting with a Russian lawyer, Natalya Veselnitskaya, who had information about Hillary Clinton. Mr Goldstone was the intermediary for Russian pop star Emin Agalaraov and his father, real estate magnate Aras, who played a role in putting on the 2013 pageant. In an email chain released by Mr Trump Jr, Mr Goldstone seemed to indicate Russian government's support of Donald Trump's campaign. . AP images . Aras Agalarov (R) is a wealthy Moscow-based real estate magnate and son Emin (L) is a pop star. Both played a role in putting on the previously Trump-owned 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. They allegedly had information about Hillary Clinton and offered that information to the Trump campaign through a lawyer with whom they had worked with, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and music publicist Rob Goldstone. .

She has ties to a Trump family connection, real estate magnate Aras Agalarov, who had helped set up the Trump-owned 2013 Miss Universe pageant which took place in Moscow. Ms Veselnitskaya met with Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort in Trump Tower on 9 June 2016 but denies the allegation that she went there promising information on Hillary Clinton's alleged financial ties to Russia. She contends that the meeting was about the US adoptions of Russian children being stopped by Moscow as a reaction to the Magnitsky Act, a US law blacklisting Russian human rights abusers. . Getty Images . Mr Flynn was named as Trump's national security adviser but was forced to resign from his post for inappropriate communication with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. He had misrepresented a conversation he had with Mr Kislyak to Vice President Mike Pence, telling him wrongly that he had not discussed sanctions with the Russian. . Getty Images . Mr Kislyak, the former longtime Russian ambassador to the US, is at the centre of the web said to connect President Donald Trump's campaign with Russia. . Reuters . Mr Stone is a former Trump adviser who worked on the political campaigns of Richard Nixon, George HW Bush, and Ronald Reagan.Mr Stone claimed repeatedly in the final months of the campaign that he had backchannel communications with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and that he knew the group was going to dump damaging documents to the campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton - which did happen. Mr Stone also had contacts with the hacker Guccier 2.0 on Twitter, who claimed to have hacked the DNC and is linked to Russian intelligence services. . Getty Images .

The timing of Mr Comey's firing raised questions around whether or not the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign may have played a role in the decision. . Getty Images . Mr Bahara refused, alongside 46 other US district attorney's across the country, to resign once President Donald Trump took office after previous assurances from Mr Trump that he would keep his job.Mr Bahara had been heading up several investigations including one into one of President Donald Trump's favorite cable television channels Fox News.Several investigations would lead back to that district, too, including those into Mr Trump's campaign ties to Russia, and Mr Trump's assertion that Trump Tower was wiretapped on orders from his predecessor. . Getty Images . Ms Yates, a former Deputy Attorney General, was running the Justice Department while President Donald Trump's pick for attorney general awaited confirmation. Ms Yates was later fired by Mr Trump from her temporary post over her refusal to implement Mr Trump's first travel ban.She had also warned the White House about potential ties former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to Russia after discovering those ties during the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign's connections to Russia. . Getty Images .  . But the fact that Mr Sessions was privy to the offer has fueled questions from legislators who say the Attorney General did not disclose the meeting when he spoke to the Senate Judiciary Committee. New Mexico Democrat told CNN that it called into question whether “whether [Mr Sessions] is being honest and forthright with the committee” and Texas Republican John Cornyn called the meeting a “legitimate area of inquiry”, CNN reported. . “Jeff Sessions concealed his meetings with the Russians and he had an obligation to be more forthcoming about meetings that involved Papadopoulos,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, told CNN. . In public testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June, Mr Sessions said he had not held other undisclosed conversations with Russian nationals or businessmen. During a Senate Judiciary Hearing last month, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham asked Mr Sessions if he ever overheard “a conversation between you and anybody on the campaign who talked about meeting with the Russians”. Mr Sessions sidestepped the query. . “I have not seen anything that would indicate a collusion with Russians to impact the campaign”, Mr Sessions replied. . The President has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia, a position he reiterated after Mr Papadopoulos’ plea was revealed and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was arrested on money laundering charges. He has said “few people knew” Mr Papadopoulos, whom he derided as a “low level volunteer” and a “liar”. . Similarly, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Mr Papadopoulos had an “extremely limited” role in the campaign. .

McMaster cited the killing in a Malaysian airport earlier this year of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un as an act of terrorism that could lead to the North being returned to a list that currently includes only Iran, Sudan and Syria. . Kim Jong-nam died in February after two women rubbed his face with a liquid later identified as VX nerve agent as he passed through the airport in Kuala Lumpur. . “A regime who murders someone in a public airport using nerve agent, and a despotic leader who murders his brother in that manner, I mean, that’s clearly an act of terrorism that fits in with a range of other actions,” the national security adviser said. . Returning North Korea to the list of state sponsors of terrorism “is something that’s under consideration”, he added. . The US kept North Korea on its terrorism blacklist for two decades after the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed 115 people.

PM reiterates commitment to two-state solution at event commemorating letter pledging British backing for a Jewish nation in Palestine . Patrick Wintour, and Peter Beaumont in Jerusalem . Thursday 2 November 2017 22.46 GMTFirst published on Thursday 2 November 2017 11.52 GMT . Theresa May has said that Britain is “proud of our pioneering role in the creation of the state of Israel” at a gala dinner in London to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Balfour declaration. . The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and a host of dignitaries attended a dinner on Thursday evening to celebrate the Balfour declaration of 1917, a statement that offered Britain’s support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people”. It was seen as the first international recognition of the need for a homeland for the Jews and went on to form the basis of Britain’s mandate for Palestine in the 1920s. . In her speech, May said Britain was proud “of the relationship we have built with Israel” and called for “renewed resolve to support a lasting peace that is in the interests of both Israelis and Palestinians”. . The prime minister discussed the chances of a peace settlement, saying: “There will need to be compromises from each side if we are to have a realistic chance of achieving this goal – including an end to the building of new settlements and an end to Palestinian incitement, too. . “But as we work together towards Balfour’s vision of a peaceful co-existence, we must be equally clear that there can never be any excuses for boycotts, divestment or sanctions: they are unacceptable and this government will have no truck with those who subscribe to them.” . Thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank city of Ramallah marched from the city centre to the British consulate, with many waving black flags and banners with slogans such as “100 years of dispossession”. . During talks between the two leaders earlier in the day, May told her Israeli counterpart that illegal settlements in Palestinian territories remained “an obstacle to peace”. She said Britain was committed to a two-state solution with a viable Palestinian state, and wanted to discuss “what we see as some of the barriers and some of the difficulties, like the illegal settlements, in relation to that peace process”. . Netanyahu, who is on a five-day visit to London, said in Downing Street: “Israel is committed to peace, I’m committed to peace. A hundred years after Balfour, the Palestinians should finally accept a Jewish national home and finally accept a Jewish state. And when they do, the road to peace will be infinitely closer. In my opinion, peace will be achievable.” . The Foreign Office knows that the Balfour declaration – seen as the Magna Carta of Jewish liberation by its supporters – represents a diplomatic minefield. It has tried to adopt a balanced approach, celebrating the role of the former British foreign secretary Arthur Balfour in the establishment of the state of Israel, but added that the 1917 declaration included a commitment to protect the rights of the Palestinian people, which the UK says remains unfulfilled. . The declaration said the British government viewed with favour “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people” so long as it did not “prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities”. . Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, stood in for the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, at the celebration dinner. Corbyn said he could not attend because of pre-existing engagements, which has been read as a snub by some in Israel and in the British Jewish community. . In a statement, the Labour leader called on the British government to recognise Palestine. He said: “Balfour promised to help establish a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine while pledging that nothing would be done to prejudice the rights of its ‘existing non-Jewish communities’,” – a reference to the Palestinian Arabs who then made up 90% of the population. . “A hundred years on, the second part of Britain’s pledge has still not been fulfilled and Britain’s historic role means we have a special responsibility to the Palestinian people, who are still denied their basic rights. . “So let us mark the Balfour anniversary by recognising Palestine as a step towards a genuine two-state solution of the Israel-Palestine conflict, increasing international pressure for an end to the 50-year occupation of the Palestinian territories, illegal settlement expansion and the blockade of Gaza.” . Manuel Hassassian, in effect the chief Palestinian diplomat to the UK, chastised the UK government’s approach, saying it should apologise for the Balfour declaration, not celebrate it. . Speaking on BBC Radio 4, he said: “The 67-word letter meant the destruction and destitution of the Palestinian people [and] bringing the Jews from Europe to Palestine – that is a crime against humanity. That is how we look at the Balfour letter.” . He said the second part of Balfour’s letter has never been fulfilled. . Hassassian said his remarks did not represent a rejection of the state of Israel. “Today we are not talking about the extermination of Israel … Instead of celebrating, marking and adding insult to injury, we Palestinians would have expected the moral and historic responsibility to be shouldered by the British government to apologise to the Palestinian people and to recognise the state of Palestine.” . He called the UK’s commitment to recognise a future Palestinian state “a hollow promise”, claiming no practical pressure had been put on Israel over its illegal settlements. Britain, he said, was “talking the talk but not walking the walk. The two-state Palestinian solution is slipping because of the continuous building of settlements by the Israelis.” . In Jerusalem, Palestinians delivered letters written by students to the British consulate on Thursday, asking why Britain had not recognised a Palestinian state. The letter, addressed to May, said if it had not been for the Balfour declaration, their lands would not have been “stolen”. . The UK has repeatedly rejected calls to apologise for the declaration and drawn back from recognising a Palestinian state, despite a House of Commons votie three years ago to do so. The Foreign Office says the time was not ripe to recognise Palestine, but did not set out the precise conditions that the Palestinians would have to meet for recognition to be offered. . "
