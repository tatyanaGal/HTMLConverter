Samantha Vadas reports. The AFP have arrested a 59-year-old Sydney man for allegedly acting as an economic agent for North Korea in Australia, in breach of both United Nations and Australian sanctions. Picture: AFPSource:AFP INTELLIGENCE experts remain perplexed over the alleged actions of an Australian man accused of trying to sell weapons for North Korea. Chan Han Choi was attempting to broker illicit deals that could have generated “tens of millions of dollars” for North Korea, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) allege. The man, who police allege is a “loyal agent of North Korea”, has been charged with trying to sell missile parts and technology on the black market to raise money for Pyongyang in a breach of international sanctions. The AFP said the 59-year-old, who was born in South Korea, was involved in discussions to set up a ballistic missile production facility and the supply of missile construction plans in addition to components, software and the transfer of technical expertise from Pyongyang. Computers, hard drives and other items were removed by the AFP from the Sydney unit of Chan Han Choi, 59Source:News Corp Australia This is the first time charges have been laid under the Commonwealth Weapons of Mass Destruction Act and for violating UN sanctions against North Korea in Australia. Intelligence experts can’t explain how the man may have fallen under the influence of the North Korean regime, but said it suggests the rogue nation has sleeper agents and sympathisers operating across the world. Lowy Institute international security director Dr Euan Graham told ABC’s AM program North Korea relies on informal networks in Australia because there is no embassy here. “This may have been as good as it gets for Pyongyang in order to fulfil that backroom economic function whether it’s over the table or under the table,” he told AM. “In this case it appears to have been more under the table ... as an export platform and way of generating hard currency which is always near the top of North Korea’s needs.” Dr Graham said this also appears to be a one-man operation when he allegedly set himself up as a broker for North Korea, but what took the temperature up was the involvement of missile technology. Choi has been charged with broking sales and discussing the supply of weapons of mass destruction to North KoreaSource:News Corp Australia He said it was unclear how Choi allegedly became swayed and it was complicated because he was originally a South Korean national. “We’re not sure exactly of the process and what made him a sympathiser to the North Korean cause,” Dr Graham said. He added there were a small number of these sympathisers and groups and fellow travellers to North Korea who were sympathetic to the regime. “We’re not talking about a large-scale movement or organised network,” he said. Professor Greg Barton, from Melbourne’s Deakin University, told the ABC he believed the likely buyer of any technology would ultimately be nation states. Police haven’t disclosed who he was allegedly attempting to sell the weapons technology to. “Well historically we’ve seen dealings between Pakistan and North Korea ... but there are many parties that would interested in looking for North Korean technology,” he said. “There are people in the middle broking on a for-profit basis so at the end of the day there has to be a buyer that wants to use the technology, so the end client is likely to be a nation state.” AFP Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said the AFP were alleging Choi was a Sydney-based “loyal agent of North Korea”. Picture: Peter Parks/AFPSource:AFP ‘LOYAL AGENT’ AFP Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said the case was “like nothing we have ever seen on Australian soil”, alleging that the man was in contact with high-ranking North Korean officials. “This man is a loyal agent of North Korea, believing he was acting to serve some higher patriotic purpose.” The alleged agent’s plans did not involve other governments or officials, police said. Authorities did not reveal which individuals or entities the man was allegedly trying to trade with. North Korea is under tough United Nations sanctions aimed at choking off revenue to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. “This is a very important arrest. The charges laid are of the greatest nature,” Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said yesterday. “North Korea is a dangerous, reckless, criminal regime threatening the peace of the region. It supports itself by breaching UN sanctions. “It is vitally important that all nations ... enforce those sanctions because the more economic pressure that can be brought on North Korea, the sooner that regime will be brought to its senses.” Choi allegedly used encrypted communication services to facilitate the attempted trades, which included the transfer of coal from North Korea to entities in Indonesia and Vietnam. Choi was refused bail yesterday after being arrested in the Sydney suburb of Eastwood on Saturday. He faces a total of six charges, with maximum penalties of up to 10 years in jail. Police revealed they began looking into his activities earlier this year after a tip-off from a “foreign law enforcement partner”, Mr Gaughan said. Police would not rule out further charges, and were probing other attempted commodity trades involving oil and gemstones, as well as investigating Choi’s activities as far back as 2008. Global anxiety about North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s authoritarian government has steadily risen this year, with Washington calling on other UN members to cut ties with Pyongyang in order to squeeze the secretive regime. — With AFP"
"1513555617.229682","http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/worldNews/~3/ZqcNjxctdHM/chiles-pinera-wins-presidency-as-opponent-concedes-idUSKBN1EB07K","US","SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Billionaire conservative Sebastian Pinera won Chile’s presidency on Sunday, with his center-left opponent Alejandro Guillier conceding the election as Chile followed other South American nations in a political turn to the right.  With 98.44 percent of the ballots counted, Pinera, 68, had won 54.57 percent in the run-off vote, to 45.43 percent for senator Guillier, a wider than expected margin in a race that pollsters had predicted would be tight.   Months of campaigning exposed deepening rifts among the country’s once bedrock center-left, an opening former president Pinera leveraged to rally more centrist voters around his proposals to cut corporate taxes, double economic growth and eliminate poverty in the world’s top copper producer.  In his concession speech at a hotel in downtown Santiago, Guillier called his loss a “harsh defeat” and urged his supporters to defend the progressive reforms of outgoing President Michelle Bachelet’s second term.  Many Chileans had viewed the election as a referendum on her policies, which focused on reducing inequality by making education more affordable and overhauling the tax code.  Pinera’s supporters cheered the news at his campaign headquarters as the results were swiftly tabulated on a hot and sunny Santiago evening.  Though neither candidate would have marked a dramatic shift from Chile’s long-standing free-market economic model, a Pinera victory underscores an increasing tilt to the right in South America following the rise of conservative leaders in Peru, Argentina and Brazil.   Pinera painted Guillier, a former TV anchorman and current senator, as extreme in a country known for its moderation, and likened him to Venezuela socialist President Nicolas Maduro.  But Pinera’s own conservative agenda may also struggle, at a time when efforts by his ideological allies in Brazil and Argentina to reduce fiscal deficits by cutting spending have faced political opposition and sparked protests.  The investor favorite, Pinera’s proposals are seen as miner-friendly in a country where copper is king. He has pledged support and stable funding for Chile’s state-run miner Codelco [COBRE.UL], and has promised to slash red tape which had bogged down projects under Bachelet.  After a leftist party made unexpected gains in November’s first round, Pinera sought to woo less well-off voters with proposals such as the creation of a public pension fund to compete with Chile’s much-criticized private pension funds, and the expansion of free education.  The race marks a turning point for Chile’s historic coalition of center-left parties, previously known as the Concertacion. The pact fissured under Bachelet, riven by disagreements over policies such as loosening Chile’s strict abortion laws and strengthening unions.   Pinera seized on the backlash, campaigning on a platform of scaling back and “perfecting” her tax and labor laws, seen by many in the business community as crimping investment at a time slumping copper prices were weighing on the economy.  “I voted for Pinera because I am an entrepreneur. I value my own efforts and do not expect much from the government,” said Rosario Poma, 53. “I think (Pinera) will be good for investment.”  Additional reporting by Felipe Iturrieta and Caroline Stauffer; Writing by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Rosalba O'Brien"

John McCain left the nation’s capital Sunday to spend Christmas in Arizona with his family as he battles brain cancer, giving his Republican Party one less vote as it is expected this week to attempt to push through a contentious tax bill along party lines. President Trump told reporters Sunday that McCain (R-Ariz.) and his wife, Cindy McCain, have “headed back [to Arizona], but I understand he’ll come if we ever needed his help, which hopefully we won’t.” He added: “But the word is John will come back if we need his vote. It’s too bad. He’s going through a very tough time, there’s no question about it. But he will come back if we need his vote.” Trump said he spoke to Cindy McCain by phone Sunday. “I wished her well. I wish John well,” he said.  McCain was hospitalized Wednesday while receiving chemotherapy treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, in Bethesda, and at the nearby National Institutes of Health. He received a diagnosis this year of glioblastoma, an aggressive, malignant brain tumor that can cause headaches, seizures, blurred vision and other symptoms. News of McCain’s travel first emerged Sunday afternoon after his daughter Meghan McCain tweeted about the family’s holiday plans. “Thank you to everyone for their kind words,” she wrote. “My father is doing well and we are all looking forward to spending Christmas together in Arizona. If you’re feeling charitable this Christmas @HeadfortheCure or @NBTStweets to help find a cure for brain cancer is what I recommend.”  McCain, 81, missed several Senate votes last week while at Walter Reed . He voted for the initial version of the tax bill, which includes sweeping tax cuts and initially passed the Senate with 51 votes. Without McCain, Republican leaders have a razor-thin margin to pass the final version, which has been in House-Senate negotiations, and cannot afford any more defections. But for Republicans, the bar to pass the legislation isn’t quite as high as initially feared. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said last week that they will vote for the measure after indicating earlier that they would not. McCain has been in “good spirits” while receiving treatment, Ben Domenech, Meghan McCain’s husband, said in an appearance Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “I’m happy to say that he’s doing well,” said Domenech, a conservative writer. “The truth is that as anyone knows whose family has battled cancer or any significant disease, that oftentimes there are side effects of treatment that you have. The senator has been through a round of chemo and he was hospitalized this week at Walter Reed.” McCain, Domenech added, “remains one of the toughest men on the face of the earth, as you know.”"

Courtesy YouTube/Jason Belmonte. IF you thought tenpin bowling was a disco-themed, clown shoe wearing sport primarily played on Saturday nights, Jason Belmonte wants you to think again. Belmonte has used tenpin to become the world’s best and the youngest player on tour to join the millionaires club. It’s a meteoric rise the Orange-born champion never thought he’d achieve, especially when criticism aimed at his controversial two-handed bowling style prompted him to quit. Belmonte started his unique double-grip technique as a toddler because the ball was too heavy. He soon realised he could succeed, so he has kept using the contentious bowling action despite constant criticism. “It has been a pretty wild ride,” Belmonte told The Sunday Telegraph. “I’ve had massive highs of winning and dreams coming true to some serious lows when you are reading and listening to people tear you apart just because you do something differently. “At every form of bowling I cop some level of criticism, even locally in Orange from older players saying, ‘hey, stop bowling like a kid and start bowling like a real bowler’. “I also get it from state and national coaches in Australia and in major competitions from my competitors who complain. “There was a stage when I took every word personally, like it was a stab to the heart and back.” Thankfully Belmonte, 34, didn’t give in and he is now on the cusp of becoming the greatest tenpin bowler ever. Since joining the professional tour in 2009, he has claimed nine PBA titles — including the honour of being the first player to win the USBC Masters on four occasions. The boy from Orange now requires two more majors to be statistically considered the world’s best tenpin bowler. It’s a record Belmonte concedes wouldn’t be in his reach without the loyal support of family and friends, who helped him overcome his critics. “They slapped me around the face and said, ‘if some words and hateful comments are going to stop you, then you shouldn’t be out there doing it’,” he said. “That’s when I had this epiphany and thought, ‘no one saying these things are going to be in my life in 10 years’ time’. “If anything, I used them as motivation to make it even worse by being the best. “So you don’t like me now, wait until I get really good and you are going to hate me.” Fuelled by the abuse and his desire to become the best, Belmonte has devoted endless hours to the world tenpin bowling circuit. His commitment is even more impressive when you consider he lives in Orange and spends four to six weeks every year on the professional tour. It’s a tough schedule for Belmonte, especially when he has to leave behind his three children Aria, Hugo, Sylvie and wife Kimberly. He regularly misses out on key life events like birthdays and personal milestones, but he is driven to succeed and make his family proud. “You are away from your country and loved ones, but you have to find that reason why you are doing it?,” reasoned Belmonte, whose father Aldo owns a number of bowling centres across NSW. “Why do I miss my kid’s dance rehearsals or first teeth falling out? “For me, it’s a part of my DNA. I love it. “You know you are going to be in a different time zone and you’re going to be tired, but once you put those shoes on you are going to get this rush. “And that’s what happens every time — this adrenaline rush hits you because you are competing at the highest level. “You want to get on the lanes and beat the other guys over and over again.” Belmonte is also motivated to silence his rivals, whose competitiveness increases as the financial incentives rise. “When it gets to that real cut throat moment when a strike is worth $60,000 to $100,000 more and you get it — yeah your opponent isn’t happy,” he grinned. “Usually they try and hold their feelings in, but sometimes it just comes out.” Beyond competing, and winning more titles, Belmonte is ultimately determined to use his profile to promote the sport of tenpin bowling. “I love tenpin and as one of the best players in the world it is my responsibility to create a platform for the next generation coming through,” he said. “The recreational side of bowling everyone knows — mates, beers, pizzas and good times. “And don’t get me wrong, I love that side of bowling. “But the other side is an extremely complicated, technical and competitive sport and that’s what I want people to understand and appreciate.” Originally published as Orange-born tenpin bowler is world’s best"

It's 10-4, but there could be so much more. ""There's room to build,"" Saints running back Mark Ingram said after leading all rushers with 74 yards on 12 carries with two touchdowns while catching six passes for 77 yards. Ingram started the game 54-yard catch and run that set up a field goal and 3-0 lead, and he ended the game with a 50-yard touchdown run with 1:33 left for the final. But the much ballyhooed, statistical dominating Saints offense did not perform well overall. There was an interception late in the first half deep in Saints territory by quarterback Drew Brees, whose ill-advised pass late in the previous game at Atlanta lost it. The pick Sunday set up a short field goal that let the Jets get within a touchdown at 17-10 at the half. ""That stinks,"" Brees said. ""That's been happening too many times to us this year."" Then Brees and company turned in back-to-back three-and-outs to open the second half as the Jets drew closer at 17-13 with another short field goal because it could not penetrate the Saints defense or the paws of defensive end Cameron Jordan, who posted up more than he bull rushed to bat down a career-high four passes. MORE: Cam Jordan has basketball skills  The defense even set up the offense when Saints linebacker Craig Robertson intercepted quarterback Bryce Petty and returned it 20 yards to the Jets' 33 in the third quarter. But on second and 10 from the Jets' 13, wide receiver Brandon Coleman fumbled it back after  6-yard reception to the 7-yard line when former LSU safety Jamal Adams popped him.. The Saints defense held. The offense then drove from their 45 to the Jets' 15, but Coleman fumbled it back again following a 16-yard reception on third and nine. The Saints defense held again. The Saints finally made it work on the third try with Coleman either not on the field or not in Brees' field of vision. Brees took the Saints 64 yards in nine plays for the touchdown to put them up by two scores at 24-13 with 7:39 to play in the game as he hit wide receiver Michael Thomas for a 4-yard touchdown. The Jets scored a meaningless touchdown in the final minutes for a 24-19 score, but the Saints recovered the onside kick. Then Ingram rambled for a 50-yard touchdown with 1:33 to play, and the Saints held on for the 31-19 final. New Orleans' defense made statements throughout the game and continued to bail out a sluggish offense.  Just before the end of the first half, the Jets took over at the Saints' 11-yard line with 1:14 to go after defensive end Leonard Williams intercepted Brees. But the Jets moved zero yards in three plays as cornerback Marshon Lattimore stopped receiver Chad Hansen for a 4-yard loss after a reception on first down. New York later settled for a 29-yard field goal for the 17-10 halftime score. ""We were a little sloppy. We have to get better,"" Ingram said. ""All I know is we got the win,"" said Robertson, who had seven tackles to go with his pick. ""We can't look at what the offense did versus what the defense did. The win is the most important thing."" The Saints improved to 10-4 with the win, giving the franchise that started playing in the NFL in 1967 just its 11th season of 10 wins or more. New Orleans stayed in first place in the NFC South with two games to play - a home game against Atlanta on Christmas Eve and the regular season finale at Tampa Bay on New Year's Eve.   Brees had little trouble in the first half against the Jets, who dropped to 5-9. He completed 15 of 19 for 176 yards and a touchdown in the first half. He finished 26 of 36 for 285 yards and two touchdowns. ""We're leaving too many things out there,"" Brees said. ""We have to be maximizing our scores when we get down there. That's going to be key the rest of the way for us.""   MORTEN ANDERSEN HONORED: Pro Football Hall of Fame member Morten Andersen, a former kicker for the New Orleans Saints from 1982-94, was placed in the Saints' ""Ring of Honor"" with his name and years played placed at the terrace level in the dome.

Cut the comedy, Daly told him. You're a very funny young man, but it won't help you make the ministry. Cohen largely ignored the advice and went on to become one of Labor's great storytellers, a master of marginal seat campaigning and, for two terms, a minister in the Hawke government. Yet his jokey exterior masked a passionate attachment to his Jewish heritage and hatred of discrimination. Barry Cohen, whose death at 82 was announced on Monday, was born in Griffith, NSW, where his father was a dentist, on April 3 1935. His grandparents had left Poland in the 1890s, ending up in Australia nearly 20 years later. But many of his wider family were killed in the Holocaust. Cohen recalled that at his first day at boarding school, he had three fights with classmates who called him ""a dirty bloody Jew"". He developed defence mechanisms: humour, and pride in the Holocaust survivors recreating a Jewish nation. Cohen's was hardly a typical Labor background. When he joined the party in 1964, having abandoned a youthful dream of being a professional golfer, he ran a posh gentlemen's outfitters on Sydney's North Shore. By then he'd married Rae McNeill, with whom he had three sons. As he's told it, he was an armchair critic of discrimination in all its forms, mouthing endlessly against anti-Semitism, apartheid and the appalling treatment of Aborigines. Then a friend asked him what he was doing about it. His answer was to join the ALP. In 1969 he won the NSW Central Coast seat of Robertson, which had been Liberal seat for 20 years. He was to hold it until he retired from politics in 1990. Since then the seat has lurched between the two parties. As a young backbencher, he completed an arts degree at the Australian National University. He went into the shadow ministry in 1977 but was dropped in 1980. However when Bob Hawke came to power in 1983, Cohen became home affairs and environment minister; changed to arts, heritage and environment in 1984. He was also minister assisting the prime minister for the Bicentennial. His most lasting achievements involved protecting some of Australia's greatest natural wonders. He extended protection to all the Great Barrier Reef and Uluru and had stage two of Kakadu National Park World Heritage-listed. He was in great demand as a speaker at ALP functions, with his imitation of Gough Whitlam's mellifluous voice greatly admired. He was in even greater demand as a marginal seat campaigner. He wrote a pamphlet, A Winning Campaign, for marginal seat candidates and ran seminars for them. In the 1984 election, he campaigned in 31 seats. At the end of the long campaign, he had a heart attack. But after the 1987 campaign his faction, the NSW Right, dumped him from its ministerial ticket. Cohen had been close to Hawke. They shared an emotional attachment to Israel and a love of golf. Hawke admitted that most of their contests on the course were to Cohen's financial advantage. But the prime minister made only a half-hearted attempt to save him and he went to the backbench for a term before retiring from parliament. Cohen remained a regular Labor Party speaker. He wrote newspaper columns and eight lighthearted books on politics, including The life of the party, a collection of political jokes; and How to become prime minister, a DIY guide for aspiring politicians. He and his wife also ran a commercial wildlife sanctuary at Calga on the Central Coast until 2005. Occasionally his serious side surfaced, as in a 2004 denunciation of Labor's growing Palestinian lobby. Or, after being diagnosed with dementia in 2014, campaigning for more government funding into the condition. But generally, he remained true to his jokey persona. He didn't regret disregarding Daly's sensible advice, he said in The life of the Party, his earliest book.

Attacks on aid workers are relatively rare in the conflict with the Islamist insurgency, compared with assaults on the military and civilians in Nigeria’s northeast.  The years of fighting have spawned what the United Nations calls one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, with 8.5 million people in need of life-saving assistance.  “WFP can confirm that a convoy escorted by the Nigerian military including WFP-hired trucks was the subject of an attack by armed groups 35 km southwest of Ngala in Borno State on Saturday,” she said in an emailed statement.   “Four people, including the driver of a WFP-hired truck and a driver’s assistant, were killed in the incident,” the statement said, adding that “WFP is working with the authorities to determine the whereabouts of the trucks.”  The spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the driver and assistant were WFP staff, or give details about the other two people killed.  A military spokesman declined to comment.  Last year, the United Nations suspended aid deliveries in Nigeria’s northeastern state of Borno, the epicenter of the conflict, after a humanitarian convoy was attacked, leaving two aid workers injured.  Last week, the Nigerian government approved the release of $1 billion from the country’s excess oil account to the government to help fight the Boko Haram insurgency, despite a two-year narrative that Boko Haram has been all but defeated.  There are other signs the government and military may be abandoning that narrative.  Nigeria’s long-term plan is now to corral civilians inside fortified garrison towns - effectively ceding the countryside to Boko Haram.  Earlier this month, Nigeria replaced the military commander of the campaign against Boko Haram after half a year in the post. Military sources told Reuters that came after a series of “embarrassing” attacks by the Islamists.

Firefighter Cory Iverson, 32, died on Thursday of burns and smoke inhalation. His funeral procession was due to wind through five southern California counties before ending up at a funeral home in San Diego, where he was based with a state fire engine strike team. He is survived by his pregnant wife and a two-year-old daughter.  The 420 sq-mile Thomas fire is also blamed for the death of a 70-year-old woman who died in a car crash on an evacuation route. The fire north-west of Los Angeles was 40% contained as work against the blaze continued, crews clearing brush and digging containment lines above hillside neighborhoods in Santa Barbara County. Firefighters took advantage of slightly calmer winds a day after gusts fanned a flare-up that prompted more evacuations. “Everything’s holding really well,” fire information officer Lisa Cox said, though she warned that lower-intensity winds were still dangerous. “Thousands of homes have been saved.”  Television footage showed at least one structure burned on property in the wealthy enclave of Montecito, which includes mansions owned by Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres and many other celebrities.  “Still praying for our little town,” Winfrey tweeted. It was not clear if the former talk show host was in Montecito.  The Thomas fire, which has become the third-largest wildfire in California history, started nearly two weeks ago. Its cause remains under investigation. More than 1,000 structures have burned, including at least 750 homes. Some 18,000 more homes are still threatened.  About 8,300 firefighters from nearly a dozen states have battled the blaze, aided by 78 bulldozers and 29 helicopters. The cause remains under investigation. Firefighting costs have surpassed $117m.  Some evacuation orders were lifted in Ventura County, where the blaze began, and officials reported progress in protecting the inland agricultural city of Fillmore.  Jim Holden returned to his neighborhood in the city of Ventura to find his home still standing amid widespread destruction. He told KABC-TV that at the height of the inferno, when it appeared his house would be lost, firefighters risked their own safety to retrieve his belongings.  “They broke in and they saved my family photos,” he said, wiping away tears.  Mike and Dana Stoneking lost their Ventura home while many of their neighbors’ properties were spared. The Stonekings planned to rebuild and found some solace after retrieving Mike’s wedding ring from the ashes."

The partial shutdown at the start of one of the busiest travel weeks of the year forced the Federal Aviation Administration to hold back flights bound for Atlanta. Departures were delayed as well because equipment inside terminals was inoperative, the agency said. The FAA flight control tower was operating normally.  The cause of the outage, which occurred just after 1 p.m. EST, was not immediately known, the airport said in a statement. It was working with crews from Georgia Power to identify the problem and fix it.    In response, United Air Lines [UALUN.UL], American Airlines [AAMRQA.UL] and Southwest Airlines suspended operations to and from Hartsfield for the rest of the day.  “We know that today has been challenging to all of our customers traveling in and out of Atlanta, and we regret your disappointment,” Southwest said in a statement.  Photos and videos posted on social media showed passengers sitting in partial darkness in crowded terminals.  “Stuck on a plane at Atlanta Airport as the power is out there ... bedlam inside and boredom out here!” Twitter user Jack Harris wrote.   Delta Air Lines said on Twitter it was working to allow customers to deplane as quickly as possible, with only a limited number of open gates available.   In response to a question from a customer, the Atlanta-based carrier said it expected service to be restored by Sunday night, although it cautioned that the airport had yet not identified the cause.   A representative of the airline, which operates a hub at Hartsfield, could not be reached immediately for an update on the status of its operations.   By 5:30 p.m. EST, 338 flights out of Hartsfield, or 32 percent, were canceled, and 238 were delayed, according to FlightAware, an airline tracking service. For flights bound for the airport, 333, or 28 percent, were canceled and 284, or 23 percent, were delayed.

Chan Han Choi was attempting to broker illicit deals that could have generated “tens of millions of dollars” for North Korea, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) allege. The man, who police allege is a “loyal agent of North Korea”, has been charged with trying to sell missile parts and technology on the black market to raise money for Pyongyang in a breach of international sanctions. The AFP said the 59-year-old, who was born in South Korea, was involved in discussions to set up a ballistic missile production facility and the supply of missile construction plans in addition to components, software and the transfer of technical expertise from Pyongyang. This is the first time charges have been laid under the Commonwealth Weapons of Mass Destruction Act and for violating UN sanctions against North Korea in Australia. Intelligence experts can’t explain how the man may have fallen under the influence of the North Korean regime, but said it suggests the rogue nation has sleeper agents and sympathisers operating across the world. Lowy Institute international security director Dr Euan Graham told ABC’s AM program North Korea relies on informal networks in Australia because there is no embassy here. “This may have been as good as it gets for Pyongyang in order to fulfil that backroom economic function whether it’s over the table or under the table,” he told AM. “In this case it appears to have been more under the table ... as an export platform and way of generating hard currency which is always near the top of North Korea’s needs.” Dr Graham said this also appears to be a one-man operation when he allegedly set himself up as a broker for North Korea, but what took the temperature up was the involvement of missile technology. He said it was unclear how Choi allegedly became swayed and it was complicated because he was originally a South Korean national. “We’re not sure exactly of the process and what made him a sympathiser to the North Korean cause,” Dr Graham said. He added there were a small number of these sympathisers and groups and fellow travellers to North Korea who were sympathetic to the regime. “We’re not talking about a large-scale movement or organised network,” he said. Professor Greg Barton, from Melbourne’s Deakin University, told the ABC he believed the likely buyer of any technology would ultimately be nation states. Police haven’t disclosed who he was allegedly attempting to sell the weapons technology to. “Well historically we’ve seen dealings between Pakistan and North Korea ... but there are many parties that would interested in looking for North Korean technology,” he said. “There are people in the middle broking on a for-profit basis so at the end of the day there has to be a buyer that wants to use the technology, so the end client is likely to be a nation state.” ‘LOYAL AGENT’ AFP Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said the case was “like nothing we have ever seen on Australian soil”, alleging that the man was in contact with high-ranking North Korean officials. “This man is a loyal agent of North Korea, believing he was acting to serve some higher patriotic purpose.” The alleged agent’s plans did not involve other governments or officials, police said. Authorities did not reveal which individuals or entities the man was allegedly trying to trade with. North Korea is under tough United Nations sanctions aimed at choking off revenue to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. “This is a very important arrest. The charges laid are of the greatest nature,” Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said yesterday. “North Korea is a dangerous, reckless, criminal regime threatening the peace of the region. It supports itself by breaching UN sanctions. “It is vitally important that all nations ... enforce those sanctions because the more economic pressure that can be brought on North Korea, the sooner that regime will be brought to its senses.” Choi allegedly used encrypted communication services to facilitate the attempted trades, which included the transfer of coal from North Korea to entities in Indonesia and Vietnam. Choi was refused bail yesterday after being arrested in the Sydney suburb of Eastwood on Saturday. He faces a total of six charges, with maximum penalties of up to 10 years in jail. Police revealed they began looking into his activities earlier this year after a tip-off from a “foreign law enforcement partner”, Mr Gaughan said. Police would not rule out further charges, and were probing other attempted commodity trades involving oil and gemstones, as well as investigating Choi’s activities as far back as 2008. Global anxiety about North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s authoritarian government has steadily risen this year, with Washington calling on other UN members to cut ties with Pyongyang in order to squeeze the secretive regime. — With AFP Originally published as North Korean sympathisers ‘everywhere’"

The port – Australia’s busiest – was blockaded at three entrances on Monday morning, with protesters blocking road entrances and unveiling a banner that read: “All refugees in detention are political prisoners.” Three climbers suspended themselves above three road entrances to the port and refused to come down. “Today we are taking action against Australia’s border policy, which remains open to corporate profits, yet is violently closed to those seeking safety,” said SOS Manus spokeswoman Charlotte Lynch. “We support the calls made by refugees and ex-detainees for international sanctions to be placed on Australia until the people on Manus are free.” The protest has caused significant traffic delays around the port. Victoria police are at the site. A spokeswoman for Victoria police said there would be a police presence at the rally to maintain public safety. “People have every right to protest. However, we ask that they do so peacefully and without impacting on the rest of the community,” she said.  “Police will be monitoring the rally to ensure there are no breaches of the peace or crimes occurring.” The deal to resettle refugees from Australian detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru in the United States is progressing on both sides. Close to 200 refugees – about 60 from Manus and 130 from Nauru – will move to the US in January. Fifty-four refugees were moved in September. But the newly reinstated travel ban imposed by the US president, Donald Trump, excludes people of certain nationalities, including Iranians and Somalis, from resettlement. Iranians are the largest national group on both Manus and Nauru. The US could take up to 1,250 refugees from Australia’s offshore camps – not enough to clear them – but it’s unclear precisely how many it will ultimately accept. Australia’s return obligation – to take central American refugees from refugee camps in Costa Rica – has also begun. Thirty people from seven families have moved to Australia after several months of assessment by the immigration department. It is understood they fled gang-related violence in El Salvador and had been living in hiding before being transferred to Costa Rica. The number of refugees fleeing criminal violence in the “northern triangle” countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras has escalated in recent years: nearly 10% of the 30 million people who live in those countries have fled across borders because of extortion, rape and forced gang recruitment after decades of civil war and conflict. Most of those displaced are fleeing north towards Mexico and the US. The US runs refugee camps in Costa Rica and has brokered assistance in resettling people from there. The US refugee deal was agreed between the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and former US president Barack Obama in November 2016. Trump has described the arrangement as a “dumb deal” and lambasted Turnbull over it during a fractious phone call in January. His administration, however, has insisted the deal will be upheld."
